#loops repeat the code inside for a specified amount of time 
#What are the two types of loops?
#Forloop and while loop
#What is iteration
#iteration is 1 loop of the same code
#What are lists? 
#Strings of multiple items that can be independently accsessed 
#How do you make lists in python? 
# plural word = ["item one", "item two", "etc"]
#How do you make for loops in python? 
#make a list; for blank in blanks: do ___
