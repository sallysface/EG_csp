#EG 7th Expressions notes

#What is an algorithm?
     #A set of instructions to complete a task
name = input("What is your name?\n")
print ("ello", name)
#Treyson has 12 apples, he has 5 friends he wants to give apples to, hgoow many apples does each friend get
apples = 12
friend = 5
print ("each friend gets", apples/friend, "apples!")



#List steps in an algorithm
    #1. declare varibles (get the info you need)
    #2. perform any equations (do the things)
    #3. print results
    #Average age in a group of four friends
age1 = 4
age2 = 6
age3 = 2
age4 = 36
average=age1 + age2 + age3 + age4
total = average/4
print ("the average age of this group is",total )
#List all of the different mathmatical operations
num1=12
num2=7

print ("addition(+):", num1+num2)
print ("subtraction(-):", num1-num2)
print ("Multiplication(*):", num1*num2)
print ("Division(/):", num1/num2)
print ("Exponents(**):", num1**num2)
print ("Integer division(//):", num1//num2)
print ("Modulo(%):", num1%num2)
#integer division only gives you the whole integer

#List all of the diferent assignment operators
#Why are expressions so important in coding?
